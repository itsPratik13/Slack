1. Background Color:
Slack has a dark-themed background that is often paired with a lighter background for content areas. You can use #222629 (dark charcoal grey) for the main background, and use lighter shades (like a very light grey or white) for the content areas.

Main Background: #222629 (Dark Charcoal Grey)
Content Areas / Chat Area: Use a slightly lighter background, such as #474b4f (Muted Dark Grey), to create separation between sections. You can also use #6b6e70 (Greyish Blue) for some sections or highlights to create a modern, subtle contrast.
Since you want to use white for text, this will work well on darker backgrounds for good contrast and readability.

Primary Text Color: Use white text (#ffffff) on dark backgrounds for titles, messages, and other text.
Secondary Text Color (for less important text): Use #6b6e70 (Greyish Blue) for secondary text, such as timestamps, user names, etc.
Titles should be prominent but not overpowering. You can use a bold, accent color for titles or headers, which can be either #61892f (Olive Green) or #86c232 (Bright Lime Green), depending on how vibrant or subtle you want the design.

Primary Title Color: #86c232 (Bright Lime Green) for main headers or titles to make them pop against dark backgrounds.
Secondary Title Color: #61892f (Olive Green) for subtler titles or section headers.
